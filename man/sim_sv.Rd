\description{
\code{sim_sv} simulate observations from a stochastic volatility model.

This function draws the initial log-volatility from its stationary distribution, meaning that \code{h_0}
is drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation \code{sigma_h} / \code{sqrt(1 - phi^2)}.
\code{h_{t+1}} is then simulated from its conditional distribution given \code{h_t}, 
which is N(\code{phi*h_t}, \code{sigma_h}). Log-returns (\code{y_t}) is
simulated from its conditional distribution given the latent process \code{h}. If \code{model} = "gaussian", 
then \code{y_t} given \code{h_t} is gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation equal to
\code{sigma_y*exp(h_t / 2)}. Heavy tail returns can be obtained by simulating from
the t-distribution by setting \code{model} = "t". How heavy of a tail is specified by the degree of freedom 
parameter \code{df}. Asymmetric returns is obtained from the "skew_gaussian" model. How asymmetric is governed by
the skewness parameter \code{alpha}. The so called leverage model, where we allow for correlation between 
log-returns and volatility can be simulated by setting \code{model} to "leverage" and specifying the
correlation parameter \code{rho}.
