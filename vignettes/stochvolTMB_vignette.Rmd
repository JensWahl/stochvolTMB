# The stochastic volatility model

The stochastic volatility model, introduced by @Taylor_SV_1982, is defined by
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        y_t &= \sigma_y e^{h_t/2} \epsilon_t, \quad t = 1, \dots, T, \\
        h_{t+1} &= \phi h_{t} + \sigma_h \eta_t, \quad t = 1, \dots, T-1, \\
        \eta_t &\stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1), \\
        \epsilon_t &\stackrel{\text{iid}} {\sim}  F
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $y_t$ is the observed log returns, $h_t$ is the logarithm of the variance on day $t$. The distribution of the innovations $\epsilon_t$ is specified below. To ensure stationarity for $h_t$, we assume $|\phi| < 1$. It can be shown that the unconditional distribution of $h_t$ is $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_h^2/(1 - \phi^2))$, and we assume $h_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_h^2/(1-\phi^2))$. An interpretation of the latent process $\{h_t\}$ is that is represents the random and uneven flow of new information into the marked. For different time points, the variance will be dependent of this unobserved ``flow'' of information, i.e. conditioning on $h_t$, $\mathrm{Var}(y_t | h_t) = \sigma_x^2 e^{h_t}$.

The original SV model from @Taylor_SV_1982 assumed normally distributed innovations, but this is usually to strong of an assumption. Financial returns are usually heavy-tailed, might be asymmetric and the volatility can be correlated with the returns. The latter is called the *leverage effect*, where there is a negative correlation between a change in price and the volatility, meaning that a drop in price tend to lead to an increase in volatility To take these features of financial time series into account `stochvolTMB` has implemented the following four distribution for the innovations: 

* Gaussian: $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
* t: $\epsilon_t \sim t_\nu(0,1)$, where $\nu$ is the degrees of freedom. 
* Skew-Gaussian: $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{SN}(0,1, \alpha)$, with zero mean, unit variance and skewness parameter $\alpha$. 
* Leverage: $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $\mathrm{Cor}(\epsilon_t, \eta_t) = \rho$

`stochvolTMB` is inspired by the package [stochvol](https://github.com/gregorkastner/stochvol) (@kastner2016), but `stochvolTMB` obtain parameter estimates through maximum likelihood estimation and not Markov Chain Monte Carlo. 

# Usage

The main functions of `stochvolTMB` are: 

----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
Function Name                 Description
----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
`estimate_parameters`         Estimate parameters of a stochastic volatility model.

`sim_sv`                      Simulate data from a stochastic volatility model.

`plot.stochvolTMB`            Plot estimated volatility (with confidence intervals).

`summary.stochvolTMB`         Extract parameter estimates and volatility with uncertainty.
----------------------------- --------------------------------------------------

`estimate_parameters` returns an object of class `stochvolTMB`. The `summary` function returns a `data.table` with estimated parameters, log-volatility and transformed parameters along with uncertainties, p-values and z-values. The argument `report = "fixed"` returns the parameters on the scale they were estimated. This means that the standard deviations $\sigma_y, \sigma_h$ are given on the log scale. This is done to ensure a positive estimate and $\phi$ is given on logit scale to ensure $|\phi| < 1$. If `report = c("fixed", "transformed")`, parameter estimates transformed back to their original scale is also returned. If you want to extract the estimated log-volatility you can use `report = "random"`. 

# Example 

Estimating parameters in a SV model is easy with `stochvolTMB`. As an example we investigate the daily log-returns of the S&P500 from 2005 to 2018. A quick look at the data:
  
```{r}
data(spy)
plot(spy$date, spy$log_return, type = "l", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Log-returns of S&P500")
plot(spy$date, spy$price, type = "l", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Price of S&P500")
```

We fit all four distributions: 
  
```{r warning=FALSE}
gaussian = estimate_parameters(spy$log_return, model = "gaussian", silent = TRUE)
t_dist = estimate_parameters(spy$log_return, model = "t", silent = TRUE)
skew_gaussian = estimate_parameters(spy$log_return, model = "skew_gaussian", silent = TRUE)
leverage = estimate_parameters(spy$log_return, model = "leverage", silent = TRUE)
```

We can investigate the estimate for the degrees of freedom (`df`) to see if the returns are heavy-tailed

```{r}
summary(t_dist, report = "fixed")
```

Clearly the returns are more heavy tailed than Gaussian, even when controlling for the stochastic volatility. We can also check for asymmetric returns

```{r}
summary(skew_gaussian, report = "fixed")
```

and leverage (`rho`)

```{r}
summary(leverage, report = "transformed")
```
There is clear evidence for both asymmetric returns and a negative correlation (of -0.74!) between log-returns and the volatility. To find the model that fits the data best, we can compare the [AIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion) of out models and pick the smallest. 

```{r}

AIC(gaussian, 
    t_dist, 
    skew_gaussian, 
    leverage)

```


Clearly the leverage model outperforms the others and is our preferred model for this dataset. Lastly, we can also plot the estimated log-volatility and percentage volatility

```{r}
plot(leverage, include_ci = TRUE, plot_log = TRUE, dates = spy$date)
plot(leverage, include_ci = TRUE, plot_log = FALSE, dates = spy$date)
```


# Comparison to stochvol

The R-package `stochvol` (@kastner2016) provides a Bayesian framework for inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. An advantage of `stochvolTMB` is that optimization can be a lot faster than MCMC. We here compare the leverage and the gaussian model. Depending on your machine you can expect a speed up of 20-200x. 


```{r include=FALSE}
stochvol_gauss <- readRDS("stochvol_gauss.rds")
stochvol_lev <- readRDS("stochvol_lev.rds")
stochvolTMB_gauss  <- estimate_parameters(spy$log_return, "gaussian", silent = TRUE)
stochvolTMB_lev  <- estimate_parameters(spy$log_return, "leverage", silent = TRUE)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(stochvol)

stochvol_gauss <- svsample(spy$log_return, quiet = T)
stochvolTMB_gauss  <- estimate_parameters(spy$log_return, "gaussian", silent = TRUE)

stochvol_lev <- svlsample(spy$log_return, quiet = T)
stochvolTMB_lev  <- estimate_parameters(spy$log_return, "leverage", silent = TRUE)
```

We can compare the parameter estimates of the two methods. Note that the parameter `exp(mu/2)` and `sigma` from `stochvol` is the same as `sigma_y` and `sigma_h` from `stochvolTMB`. Both methods give almost identical results. 


```{r}

stochvol_gauss$para
summary(stochvolTMB_gauss, report = "transformed")
stochvol_lev$para
summary(stochvolTMB_lev, report = "transformed")

```

# Estimation 

The R-package `TMB` (@TMB_2016) is used to implement our models for maximum likelihood estimation, since `TMB` lets us estimate parameters in models with a high number of latent variables.

Parameter estimation of stochastic volatility models is hard due to the fact the likelihood function is expressed as a high dimensional integral over the latent variables that cannot be evaluated analytically. If $\boldsymbol{y} = (y_1, \ldots, y_T)$ denotes our observations, $\boldsymbol{h} = (h_1, \ldots, h_T)$ our latent variables and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ the parameters of interest, the likelihood of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \int f_{\boldsymbol{y}}(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{h})f_{\boldsymbol{h}}(\boldsymbol{h}) \, d\boldsymbol{h},
\end{equation}

The conditional density of our observations given $\boldsymbol{h}$ is denoted by $f_{\boldsymbol{y}}(\boldsymbol{y|u})$, and $f_{\boldsymbol{h}}(\boldsymbol{h})$ denotes the marginal density of $\boldsymbol{h}$. To approximate this integral we apply the Laplace approximation. 

## Laplace Approximation 

Let $\boldsymbol{y}$ be a vector of observations, $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ our parameters of interest and $\boldsymbol{h}$ be a random vector of latent variables. Let $g(\boldsymbol{h},\boldsymbol{\theta})$ denote the negative joint log-likelihood. The likelihood of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is given by

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \int f(\boldsymbol{y},\boldsymbol{h}) \, d\boldsymbol{h} = \int f_{\boldsymbol{y}}(\boldsymbol{y|u}) f_{\boldsymbol{h}}(\boldsymbol{h}) \, d\boldsymbol{h} = \int \exp \{-g(\boldsymbol{h},\boldsymbol{\theta})\} \, d\boldsymbol{h}.
\end{equation}

We assume that $g$ has a global minimum at $\boldsymbol{\hat{h}}$ for a given $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{\hat{h}} = \text{argmin}_{\boldsymbol{h}} g(\boldsymbol{h},\boldsymbol{\theta})$, and that $g$ is twice differentiable. The solution $\hat{\boldsymbol{h}}$ is known as the *Empirical Bayes* (EB) estimate. A second order Taylor expansion around $\boldsymbol{\hat{h}}$ yields

\begin{equation}
    g(\boldsymbol{h},\boldsymbol{\theta}) \approx g(\boldsymbol{\hat{h}},\boldsymbol{\theta}) + \nabla g(\boldsymbol{\hat{h}},\boldsymbol{\theta})(\boldsymbol{h} - \boldsymbol{\hat{h}}) + \frac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{h} - \boldsymbol{\hat{h}})^T\mathbb{H}(\boldsymbol{h} - \boldsymbol{\hat{h}})
\end{equation}

Since $\boldsymbol{\hat{h}}$ is a minimum, $\nabla g(\boldsymbol{\hat{h}},\boldsymbol{\theta}) = 0$. Therefore

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \approx \exp \{-g(\boldsymbol{\hat{h}},\boldsymbol{\theta})\} \int \exp \bigg \{-\frac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{h} - \boldsymbol{\hat{h}})^T\mathbb{H}(\boldsymbol{h} - \boldsymbol{\hat{h}}) \bigg \} d\boldsymbol{h}
\end{equation}

We can observe that the integrand is the kernel of a multivariate normal density with covariance matrix $\mathbb{H}^{-1}$. The approximation is therefore given by 

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \approx \exp \{-g(\boldsymbol{\hat{h}},\boldsymbol{\theta})\} (2\pi)^{\text{dim}(\boldsymbol{h})/2} \text{det}(\mathbb{H})^{-1/2},
\end{equation}

where we have used the fact that $\text{det}(\mathbb{H}^{-1}) = \text{det}(\mathbb{H})^{-1}$. The corresponding negative log-likelihood is 

\begin{equation}
    -l(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = -\frac{\text{dim}(\boldsymbol{h})}{2} \log (2\pi) + \frac{1}{2} \log \text{det}(\mathbb{H}) + g(\boldsymbol{\hat{h}},\boldsymbol{\theta}).
\end{equation}

Finding the optimal value of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ can be viewed as a nested optimization problem. To
find $\boldsymbol{h} (\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and $\mathbb{H}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ we fix $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ and optimize using a quasi-Newton algorithm or a limited
memory Newton method. The Laplace approximation is then optimized w.r.t. $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ using
the quasi-Newton algorithm.
